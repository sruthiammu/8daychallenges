This case study has LOTS of questions - they are broken up by area of focus including:

Pizza Metrics
Runner and Customer Experience
Ingredient Optimisation
Pricing and Ratings
Bonus DML Challenges (DML = Data Manipulation Language)
Each of the following case study questions can be answered using a single SQL statement.

Again, there are many questions in this case study - please feel free to pick and choose which ones youâ€™d like to try!
-- 
Before you start writing your SQL queries however - you might want to investigate the data, you may want to do 
something with some of those null values and data types in the customer_orders and runner_orders tables!
